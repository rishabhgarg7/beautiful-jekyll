## What is the problem that ConvNets try to solve?

ConvNets or Convolution Neural Network is a special type of Neural Network which try to solve the problem related to visual data(Images , Videos).

## What is the problem with Vanilla Neural Network?

They don't process the data in the same way we human does.

# Why understanding ConvNets can be a tedious task?

Because of the number and type of layers they include.
Convolutional neural networks are deep artificial neural networks that are used primarily to classify images (e.g. name what they see), cluster them by similarity (photo search), and perform object recognition within scenes. They are algorithms that can identify faces, individuals, street signs, tumors, platypuses and many other aspects of visual data.

Convolutional networks perform optical character recognition (OCR) to digitize text and make natural-language processing possible on analog and hand-written documents, where the images are symbols to be transcribed. CNNs can also be applied to sound when it is represented visually as a spectrogram. More recently, convolutional networks have been applied directly to text analytics as well as graph data with graph convolutional networks.

The efficacy of convolutional nets (ConvNets or CNNs) in image recognition is one of the main reasons why the world has woken up to the efficacy of deep learning. They are powering major advances in computer vision (CV), which has obvious applications for self-driving cars, robotics, drones, security, medical diagnoses, and treatments for the visually impaired.
