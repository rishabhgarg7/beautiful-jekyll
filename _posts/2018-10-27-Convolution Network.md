## What is the problem that ConvNets try to solve?

ConvNets or Convolution Neural Network is a special type of Neural Network which try to solve the problem related to visual data(Images , Videos).

## What is the problem with Vanilla Neural Network?

They don't process the data in the same way we human does.
